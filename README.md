# Turbin3 WBA Q4 2024 Portfolio üöÄ  
This repository highlights my journey through the Turbine3 WBA Cohort Q3 2024, where I explored decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and programmatic token mechanics using Solana‚Äôs Anchor framework.

The portfolio is organized week-by-week, with each project demonstrating core concepts of Solana development‚Äîranging from token creation and NFT marketplaces to more advanced mechanisms like staking systems, decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMM), vaults, escrows, and blink contracts.

## üìÅ Project Index  
**Week 1:**  
- **SPL Token Basics:** Created, minted, and transferred SPL tokens to associated accounts.  
- **NFT Minting:**  Built custom NFTs using Metaplex and added metadata through Arweave.  

**Week 2:**  
- **Vault Program:** Designed a secure token vault for deposits and withdrawals.  
- **Escrow Service:** Developed a trustless escrow program with maker, taker and refund capabilities.

## üèÜ Capstone Project: 

### **Turbine3 Capstone initial draft [26 Oct 2024]**

**1. Brief Project Description**
   
I am building Solynx, a decentralized web hosting platform similar to Vercel or Firebase. The goal is to provide developers with tools to upload, build, and deploy web applications on decentralized networks such as Arweave and IPFS. Instead of relying on centralized cloud services like AWS, Solynx leverages blockchain technology for decentralized storage, domain management, and payment processing, ensuring true ownership, transparency, censorship resistance, and scalability at reduced costs.

**3. The reason I am building/choosing this project is...**
   
Getting access to AWS and other compute services without a credit card is challenging, and Vercel's free tier becomes unreliable beyond 5,000 to 10,000 users, becoming expensive quickly. Therefore, I plan to build a decentralized web hosting platform that offers cost-effective, censorship-resistant, and reliable alternatives using blockchain and decentralized storage.

**5. Go-to-Market Strategy**
   
- Target Audience: Developers looking for alternatives to Vercel, Firebase, and AWS.
- Launch Approach: Provide early access to Web3 projects and incentivize usage through free deployments and referral programs.
- Partnerships: Collaborate with blockchain platforms like Solana, and decentralized domain providers like ENS/SNS.
- Monetization: Introduce microtransaction-based payments using Solana, with optional premium features (analytics, caching, custom domains).
- Marketing Channels: Twitter ([x.com/Solynx108](https://x.com/Solynx108)), Web3 communities, GitHub, and developer conferences.

**7. Tech: The technologies I will use in my build are...**
   
- Blockchain: Solana (for payments and tracking deployments)
- Decentralized Storage: Arweave and IPFS (for hosting content)
- Domains: ENS, SNS, or Unstoppable Domains (for domain resolution)
- Containerization: Docker (for building front-end code)
- Queue Management: Redis (for task queuing)
- Caching & Performance: Cloudflare Workers or other edge caching solutions

**8. Method: Programming Language for SC / Testing**
   
- Smart Contract Language: Rust 
- Testing Framework:Anchor 

**9. Front End Plans (Ok if you need help here)**
    
- Framework: Frontend will likely be built using Next.js or React.
- Hosting: The front end will be hosted on decentralized storage networks like Arweave.
- Web3 Integration: Include authentication with ENS domains and allow users to manage deployments directly from the frontend.
- Future Enhancements: Build an analytics dashboard to show deployment metrics and traffic statistics.
