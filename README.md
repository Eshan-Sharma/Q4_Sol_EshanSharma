# Turbin3 WBA Q4 2024 Portfolio 🚀  
This repository highlights my journey through the Turbine3 WBA Cohort Q3 2024, where I explored decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and programmatic token mechanics using Solana’s Anchor framework.

The portfolio is organized week-by-week, with each project demonstrating core concepts of Solana development—ranging from token creation and NFT marketplaces to more advanced mechanisms like staking systems, decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMM), vaults, escrows, and blink contracts.
